## PCIDSS Compliant Oracle Gateway

PCIDSS Compliant Oracle contains set of services to process ISO-8583 services, sync with Substrate chain and maintain local ledger. In a nutshell, it mocks a traditional bank which has issued some cards and is currently used for implementing a PoC implementation of ISO-8583 on a Substrate based blockchain.

### What it does?

Oracle service implements an RPC API for processing incoming ISO-8583 messages via `MsgProcessor` trait of `iso_8583rs` crate. In the future watcher service will be added, which will be used to subscribe to the Substrate chain for further integration of ISO-8583 standard.

### How to run

**Pre-requisites**

- Rust toolchain (tested with version 1.72.0)
- Postgres database (tested with version 14.9)

To run the oracle:

```bash
make run

# OR

cargo run --release -p pcidss-oracle -- --dev
```

To build the binary for release and run it:

```bash
make build
# OR
cargo build --release

./target/release/pcidss-oracle
```

To build the Docker image:

```bash
make docker-build
# OR
docker build --platform linux/x86_64 -t pcidss-oracle .
```

To run the Docker image:

```bash
make docker-run
# OR
# NOTE: your Postgres database should be accessible via host.docker.internal
docker run -p 0.0.0.0:3030:3030 --platform linux/x86_64 -it pcidss-oracle --database-host host.docker.internal --iso8583-spec /usr/bin/spec.yaml
```

#### CLI

Oracle service accepts the following arguments (which can be seen by running `pcidss-oracle --help`):

```bash
Usage: pcidss-oracle [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --database-host <DATABASE_HOST>
          Path to the Postgres database [default: localhost]
      --database-port <DATABASE_PORT>
          Port of the Postgres database [default: 5432]
      --database-user <DATABASE_USER>
          Username of the Postgres database [default: postgres]
      --database-name <DATABASE_NAME>
          Name of the Postgres database [default: postgres]
      --chain-endpoint <CHAIN_ENDPOINT>
          Substrate chain websocket endpoint [default: ws://localhost:9944]
      --iso8583-spec <ISO8583_SPEC>
          ISO-8583 specification file [default: spec.yaml]
      --rpc-port <RPC_PORT>
          RPC port [default: 3030]
      --dev
          Run in development mode (development accounts are injected)
  -h, --help
          Print help
```

#### Testing

Oracle service has integration tests for the ISO-8583 message processing logic. You can run them with:

> **_NOTE:_** Integration tests are run in parallel by default. This might cause issues with Postgres database, so we should run them in a single thread and one by one.

```bash
make test
# OR
cargo test --test-threads=1
```

#### Linting and formatting

Oracle service uses `rustfmt` and `clippy` for formatting and linting. You can run them with:

```bash
make lint
```
