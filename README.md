# ISO-8553 Infrastracture

This repository contains the infrastructure for ISO-8553 implementation for Substrate based chains. It contains of parts that are responsible for processing ISO-8553 messages, maintaining offchain ledger. With these components, it will be possible to mock full cycle of ISO-8583 messages.

## Notes

Some important notes about the project:

- It is a PoC implementation, so there are many places where we cut corners and some things are hard coded.
- ISO-8583:1987 standard is used.
- Substrate chain integration is not implemented yet.
- Unit tests are more like integration tests (somewhat similar to Substrate).

## Contents

Contains three key parts for ISO-8553 message processing:

1. [Demo merchant application](./interface/README.md)
2. [Server application](./payment-processor/README.md) for processing requests from merchant application
3. PCIDSS compliant [oracle](./pcidss/README.md)

### Demo Merchant Application

React application with mock bank interface and a demo checkout page.

### Payment Processor Server

NodeJs server that is responsible for processing requests from merchant application and sending them to the gateway simulator.

### PCIDSS Compliant Oracle Gateway

JSON-RPC based message consumer that maintains offchain ledger and a processor for ISO-8553 messages. In the future will have Substrate chain watcher service integrated.
